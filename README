# IITH_seismo

This is a private repository for the members of IITH-SeismicSource Group. 
It can be downloaded using the following command at the terminal:
```
`git clone https://github.com/vsilwal/IITH_seismo`
```
Let me know if there is any permission issue..

This repository contains utilities that could be of use for other members of the group 
(like: meshing, data processing, plotting, etc). 
Most packages start like this until they are ready to be shared publicly or become an independent repository of its own.

For now it contains three repositories:
CUBIT - For building geometry and mesh in Cubit
matlab_util - For matlab functions 
python_util - For python functions
Similarly you can add perl, C, etc as you feel the need.
